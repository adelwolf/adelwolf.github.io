  <h1>Documentation</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Adelbot is a easy-to-use multi-purpose administration bot for Discord. This article is meant to help anyone who has questions about adelbot!</p>
  <h2>Basic info</h2>
    <p>Each action for adelbot starts with "adel:", also known as a prefix.</p>
    <p>After each prefix comes the command. The command specifies what you want adelbot to do</p>
    <p>After the command there may be another required input, also known as an argument. This gives the bot more information about the specified task.</p>
  <h2>Role Configuration</h2>
    <p>In order to make adelbot function correctly, you must adjust a few simple things in your server.</p>
    <p>First you should make a new role with the name "Muted", make sure it's typed exactly like that!</p>
    <p>After you make the role, go into permissions and uncheck "Send Messages" for that role. This will make them unable to talk in text chat! Now the mute command will work properly!</p>
    <p>In order for your staff to be able to use commands, make a "Staff" role, make sure it's typed exactly like that! The people with that role will be able to use moderation commands!</p>
    <p>[OPTIONAL] If you want a NSFW system, add an NSFW role. Then disallow access to your default role in an NSFW channel, and allow access for the NSFW role. Now the NSFW command is set up!</p>
  <h2>Commands</h2>
    <p>Now we'll go over each command, what it does, and how to use it!</p>
    <p><b>adel:info</b> - This command gives you general information about the bot!</p>
    <p><b>adel:kick @user [reason]</b> - This kicks a specified user from your server. @user is the user mentioned, and [reason] is the reason to kick them.</p>
    <p><b>adel:ban @user [reason]</b> - This bans a specified user from your server. @user is the user mentioned, and [reason] is the reason to ban them.</p>
    <p><b>adel:mute @user</b> - <ins>REQUIRES CONFIGURATION!</ins> This mutes a specified user. @user is the user mentioned.</p>
    <p><b>adel:nsfw</b> - <ins>REQUIRES CONFIGURATION!</ins> This applies an NSFW role to yourself.</p>
    <p><b>adel:filter</b> - Enables and disables the word filter on a server.</p>
    <p><b>adel:getlastmsg @user</b> - Gets a user's last sent message seen by the bot.</p>
    <p><b>adel:server</b> - Shows information about the current server.</p>
